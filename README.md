# ImperialDuty Script

The **ImperialDuty** script is designed to manage duty statuses and equipment within the game. This script allows users to toggle their on-duty status with a simple `/duty` command, automatically integrating this status into the **Imperial911** script. It also equips users with predefined weapons configured within the script settings, enhancing the gameplay experience for role-play scenarios.
